//* Method overriding
//  if we create our own implementation to run , it will not be taken from the animal class
//   this is called Method overriding

// * Super Keyword
//  when we override a method , we dont want the method of previous class to go in
//     we execute it using super keyword
//    super(a.b) --> call parent comstructor
