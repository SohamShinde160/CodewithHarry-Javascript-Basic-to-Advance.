//  variable is a container which stores particular datatypes
// datatypes - integer , string, float , number , character
// javascript allows us to change a one variable value during runtime
// means - you can assign a variable with multiple data types becoz it is dynamic programming language
// but C language is static language it dosent allow to change value during runtime
// Variable can be declared using ( var , let , const)
let a = 50
console.log(a)
a = 'soham'
console.log(a)
//  here a is identifier , = assignment operator , 50 or soham literal (constant value)


// Rules for declaring a variable
// 1. letters , digits and _underscore and $ sign allowed to start with variable name
// 2. you cannot declare variable starting with number
// 3. javascript reserved word you cannot be used as variable name
// 4. soham & Soham are different variables ( case sensitive language)
