// always prefer to use let and const to declare a variable in javascript
// mostly use const
// avoid to usage of var variable to declare variable in javscript
// var can introduce bug in your code
// const = can be used to declare a constant i.e, if you want that value to not to be changed
// var is globally scoped while let & const is block scoped
// var can be updated and redeclared within its scope
// let can be updated but cannot be redeclared
//               let a = 5
//               let a = 'soham' -----> redeclared i.e, not possible in case of let (error)
//               a = 'soham'     -----> updated
// const cannot be updated and cannot be redeclared
//           const coder = 'soham'
//           let coder = 'not soham'-----> here trying to redeclare ... throws error
//           coder ='not soham' -----> here trying to update ... throws error
//  it will say that either change the variable name or dont declare
